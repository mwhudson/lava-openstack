These scripts are executed in order to install and configure an
openstack cloud and then set up tempest to run against it.

Some later steps depend on explicit and implicit things earlier steps
do (e.g. the creation of the ~/admin-openrc file).  That's all a bit
ugly currently.

The scripts are run with cwd set to the "juju" folder and some scripts
depend on this (e.g. to access the deploy-data directory).
